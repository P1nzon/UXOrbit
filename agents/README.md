# Agents Directory

This directory contains agent modules for the Multi-Agent UX Testing Dashboard.

## Agent Types

- **FormFillingAgent**: Automates form filling and validation tasks.
- **NavigationTestingAgent**: Validates navigation, links, and page transitions.
- **FeedbackAgent**: Performs usability and accessibility analysis.
- **AgentOrchestrator**: Coordinates agent activities and manages test sessions.

## Architecture Overview

Agents operate independently and communicate via the AgentOrchestrator. Each agent is responsible for a specific aspect of UX testing. The orchestrator manages agent lifecycle, aggregates results, and interfaces with the backend API.

## File Structure & Naming

- Each agent is implemented as a separate class/module.
- Use clear, descriptive filenames (e.g., `FormFillingAgent.js`).
- Shared logic and utilities should be placed in the `backend/utils/` directory.

## API Documentation (To be added)

- Endpoints for starting tests, retrieving results, and checking status will be documented in subsequent phases.

## Usage Examples (To be added)

- Example usage and integration patterns will be provided as agent modules are implemented.
